## Applied Machine Learning for Real-world projects and applications
### Predict Password Strength using Natural Language Processing	
Reading and coding dataset to check missing values via seaborn framework to visualize data, performing spontaneous shuffling for robustness, employing TfidfVectorizer from sklearn to apply on data, dividing data to train and test set for assessing relationship and predictions.
Attained 0.83 accuracy on test set after employing logistic on data as use-case is classification and doing predictions on specific customize data. 
### Predict Fare of Airplane Tickets using Machine Learning 	
Derived dataset from domestic airplane data in India, 2019. Led cleaning and preprocessing raw data into new via outliners and features removal. 
Selected appropriate features by visualizing data on pie/bar charts with matplotlib, integrating machine learning model to data with random forest algorithm, automating machine learning pipeline, hyper tuning machine learning model, and attaining 0.82 accuracy.

### Predict the stock price using time series
Reading and coding dataset to drop all null values with two main library are numpy and pandas, using plotly to visualize data to select lag values and lagged features. Apply pmdarima algorithm to train the model and predict the price of stock depending on lag values in the past.
